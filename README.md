## Welcome to my GitHub page

- Hello, I’m @privatecat.
- I’m interested in using data science to study public policy problems, especially in the courts and legal system.
- I’m growing my skills in data modeling in R as well as designing and developing relational and NoSQL databases. 
- Reach out if you are working on projects related to improving access to justice in civil and criminal contexts.
